- 👋 Hi, I’m @johnpmeyer
- 👀 I’m interested in pulling, analyzing, and explaining data. I'm especially interested in accessing 3rd party APIs to pull together data, creating dashboards, and running ad-hoc analysis (forecasting, segmentation, etc)
- 🌱 I finished a masters in data science and analytics at Georgia Tech in 2024.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on forecasting and anything else related to marketing & product analytics.
